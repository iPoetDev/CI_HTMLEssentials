                    Bewildered, two Muggles at London were convinced they saw an old car flying over
                    the Post Office tower at noon in Norfolk. Mrs Hetty Bayliss spotted the Flying
                    Ford Anglia while hanging out her washing in her locality of Watford. Mr Angus
                    Fleet of Peebles reported the flying car to police at his local Finchley
                    station. Six or seven Muggles in all reported the Flying Ford Anglia. The
                    Improper Use of Magic Office is investigating the incident.
